20/07/17 - version 2.8
        -   Added isHandleValid() method.
            This method provides a means to check if the specific target application instance (which you have been reading from)
            has closed or restarted.
        -   The default value of the endAddress parameter in processPatternScan() has been modified.
            If unspecified its value now depends on the bitness of the AHK script and target process. Refer to method description for details.
    18/07/17 - version 2.7
        -   Added numberOfBytesRead() and numberOfBytesWritten() methods.
            These return the number of bytes read or written by the last ReadProcessMemory()/WriteProcessMemory() operation.
    01/02/17 
        - Calling __New() and passing an 'ahk_pid' windowTitle will now work with console apps (which don't have windows).
    05/07/16 - version 2.6
        - When possible, the more reliable getModuleBaseAddress() method is used to set the object.BaseAddress property.
    30/03/16 - version 2.5
        - Fixed a bug causing getModules() to return 0 when useFileNameAsKey was enabled.
    20/01/16 - version 2.4
        - Added two methods to help create array of byte patterns.
            1. hexStringToPattern(hexString)
            2. stringToPattern(string, encoding := "UTF-8", insertNullTerminator := False)
    25/12/15 - version 2.3
        - Virtual protect (MCode()) is now called for 32 bit scripts. Previously the function would fail when DEP was enabled for all applications.
    5/12/15 - version 2.2
        - Added the useFileNameAsKey option to getModules(). When enabled, the module's file name is used as the key to the module object i.e. an associative array.
        - Added setSeDebugPrivilege() method.
    10/10/15 - version 2.1
        - Optimised the pointer() method.
        - Corrected some DLLCall types (the previous types would still work fine)
    06/08/15 - version 2.0
        -   Fixed an issue with getProcessBaseAddress() on 32 bit OS systems.
            The returned value was incorrect - however it would still work, as the lower 4 bytes were correct. 
    07/05/15 - version 1.9
        - Fixed an issue with processPatternScan() failing when the startAddress was not 0. 
    17/12/14 - version 1.8
        - Fixed a 'bitness' bug in _MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION 
    12/12/14 - version 1.7
        - Added an 'endAddress' parameter to processPatternScan.
    10/11/14 - version 1.6
        - Wild card bytes in the pattern scan functions can now be denoted by any non-numeric value e.g. "?", "wild" or "" (null)
    17/10/14 - version 1.5
        - Fixed a bug in writeString() which would cause the null terminator to be erroneously removed. 
    23/09/14 - version 1.4
        - The various read and write methods should now support pointers in 64 bit target applications providing AHK is also 64 bit.
            -> When the new operator is used the target application's bitness is checked. If it 64 bit, pointers will then be read as Int64s.
            -> A 32 bit AHK can read/write and use pointers in a 64 bit target application providing the addresses can fit inside a 4 byte ptr.
               If the address is too large, only the lower 4 bytes are passed to ReadProcessMemory()/WriteProcessMemory() i.e. the wrong address is passed.
        - readString() has been slightly optimised when reading null terminated strings of unknown size.
        - New methods:  
            - suspend(), resume(), and isTargetProcess64Bit()
        - OpenProcess() has been modified and closeProcess() has been replaced by CloseHandle()
            -> These two changes will not affect users unless your code calls them directly.
        - Fixed a bug in _MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION
        - Added 'aRights' object which contains various handle access constants.
    19/09/14 - version 1.3
        -   Renamed some methods.
        -   Old name --> New name
        -   getBaseAddressOfModule() --> getModuleBaseAddress()
        -   ReadRawMemory() --> readRaw()
        -   writeBuffer() --> writeRaw()
    17/08/14
        -   Change class name to _ClassMemory
    1/08/14 - version 1.2
        -   getProcessBaseAddress() dllcall now returns Int64. This prevents a negative number (overflow)
            when reading the base address of a 64 bit target process from a 32 bit AHK process.
        -   Added various pattern scan methods.
    30/07/14 - version 1.1
        -   EnumProcessModulesEx() is now used instead of EnumProcessModules().
            This allows for getModuleBaseAddress() in a 64 bit AHK process to enumerate
            (and find) the modules in a 32 bit target process.
    12/07/14 - version 1.0
        -   Added writeRaw() method
        -   Added a version number to the class
    10/06/14
        -   Fixed a bug introduced by the above change, which prevented the function returning 
            the base address of the process.
    18/05/14
        -   Fixed issue with get getModuleBaseAddress() returning the incorrect module 
            when specified module name formed part of another modules name
